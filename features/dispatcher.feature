Feature  STANDALONE DISPATCHER

   As a Standalone Dispatcher
   
   I need 
     the ability to run Dispatch V1.6 
	 and connect to the local database. The local database must 
	  contain a recently refreshed set of data for my Ross terminal.
	 
	 
    So that 
	  I can see my customer list and my trucking routes and use them for dispatch.
