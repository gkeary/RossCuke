@A
Feature  STANDALONE DISPATCHER

   As a Standalone Dispatcher
   
   I need the ability to run Dispatch V1.6 and connect to the local database.  The 
   local database must contain a recently refreshed set of data for my Ross terminal.  
   
   So that I can dispatch with  my customer list, trucking routes and drivers.
