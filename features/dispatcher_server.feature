Feature  SERVER-BASED DISPATCHER

   As a Server-based Dispatcher
   
   I need the ability to run Dispatch V1.6 and connect to my Dispatch server.  The 
      server database must contain my Ross terminal's Customer, Route and Driver data.  
	 And the data must be fresh.
	
   So that I can dispatch with  my customer list, trucking routes and drivers.
